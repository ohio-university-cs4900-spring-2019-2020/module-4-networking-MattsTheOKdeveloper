Hello.

My module builds and runs on my computer; however any new files I write - the ones I included not in a folder - get placed into my cwin64 folder. My entire file explorer for these assignments is kinda wonky, but I'm making it work, if you need to see it run on my machine then I can come in and demonstrate it. 

If you can get it to work, then thats even better. 

#### **IMAGINE**

You load into the world (with both instances running), awakened from what you thought was a terrible nightmare, only to have it now be reality. Not just a "normal" reality, but the fabric of space has been torn and you're seeing dual planes of existence at the same time. All you see is a banana, but its not just any banana: its a banana that transcends space and you can control it in one plane, and any movement you make it do, also moves it in the other plane, who knows how many realities this bananas spans.

All the while, you're being pelted by that song, that god forsakened song...
